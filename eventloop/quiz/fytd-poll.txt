In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.
Order of execution would be: 
foo
done
Read Error

The code would run synchronously on the main thread. As there is a I/O operation in someAsyncOperation() it would be queued to the poll phase 
of the eventloop. 
Now foo() would be executed and 'foo' would be logged on to the console. 
Then 'done' would be logged on to the console. 
Now, as the operations on the main thread are over, now the eventloop would be executed. 
The operation present in the queue of the poll phase would be executed. So now fs.readFile would be executed and then 'Read Error' 
would be logged on to the console.
