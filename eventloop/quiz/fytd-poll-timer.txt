- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.

Order of execution: 
someAsyncOperation
112ms have passed since I was scheduled

Firstly, the fs.readFile would be queued to the Poll phase of the event loop. Then, the setTimeOut() would be queued to the timers phase. 
After the main thread is executed, the poll phase would get executed and the callback method someAsyncOperation would be executed and 
'someAsyncOperation' would be logged on to the console. Then, the setTimeOut would be then executed as it would now be in the pending_callback
stage. So, '112ms have passed since I was scheduled'

- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?

No, if delay is changed from 10s to 150s then the order of execution would not be changed as till then the File I/O would be done and callback
would be executed. And then the timers phase would be executed.



- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
Yes, the order would change in this case. It is because, in 0 ms the file IO would not have completed and the setTimeout on the timers phase 
would now be on pending_callback stage and it would be executed first. So '3ms have passed since I was scheduled' would be logged on to the
console first and then 'someAsyncOperation' would be logged.
